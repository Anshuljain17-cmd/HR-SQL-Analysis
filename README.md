## Objective

To demonstrate real-world SQL use cases in HR Analytics—covering employee salaries, headcount, tenure, and top performer identification.

2. **Top Paid Employee per Dept** – Identify top earners using `RANK()`  
3. **Headcount by Department** – View department sizes  
4. **New Joiners by Year** – Spot hiring trends  
5. **Top Performer (2023)** – Rank best employee by department
